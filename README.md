# haskell-notes
Non-published material from [IOGs Haskell course](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell-course). 

## How to run the code
The jupyter notebook lessons can be found in the *lessons* folder. 

If you want to run the jupyter notebook code cells you can do this by using the
[ihaskell-notebook](https://github.com/jamesdbrock/ihaskell-notebook/pkgs/container/ihaskell-notebook). 

The homework instructions can be found in the *homework* folder. Solutions to homework can be found 
on the **solutions** branch. Both are simple haskell files.
