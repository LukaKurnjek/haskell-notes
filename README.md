# haskell-course
A simplified version of [IOGs Haskell course](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell-course) 
for more or less experienced imperative programmers.

This Haskell course tries to find the right balance in explaining a new programming 
concept of purely functional programming, to programmers which know how to write 
imperative code (C++, Java, Python, ...).

It generally spents less time as IOGs haskell course when explain programming basics 
as e.g. recursion, Haskell concepts as purity or Haskell fetaures as input-output computation. 

Never the less it does not leave out important concepts and it showcases it with
extended examples. 

The lessons follow the same outline as the official IOGs haskell course I was 
working on. The homework of this course is more or less the same as the one in 
IOGs course. 

## How to run the code
The jupyter notebook lessons can be found in the *lessons* folder. You will be
taught in lesson 1 how to compile and interact with haskell code in the GHCi repl.

If you want to run the jupyter notebook code cells you can do this by using the
[ihaskell-notebook](https://github.com/jamesdbrock/ihaskell-notebook/pkgs/container/ihaskell-notebook)
which will also be explained in lesson 1. 

The homework instructions can be found in the *homework* folder and are written
in pure haskell files. Solutions to homework can be found on the **solutions** 
branch and are also written as pure haskell files.
